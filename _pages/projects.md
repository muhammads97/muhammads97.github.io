You also can check my Github account at [muhammads97](https://github.com/muhammads97) for a complete list of public reposetories and contribution history.

*Note: My Github repositories include a lot of unfinished projects, I know it's messy, I will try to clean it up a little later :D*

## [SGLICollect](https://github.com/muhammads97/SGLICollect)
SGLICollect is an open source software for searching, downloading and reading SGLI/GCOM-C products from both GPORTAL and JASMES. \
This project is built using Python as the main programming language, it's developed for the research community, and will soon have a Graphical User Interface for the ease of use. I will also create an installable version of the software so that the dependencies don't cause any problems for the users. it's still under development, feel free to create issues or PR. \

## 3LATNet
This is 3LATNet: a deep learning model for the estimation of Chla concentration using the Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs) of the SGLI sensor hosted on the GCOM-C satellite. This model is based on the LSTM network and the attention mechanism. 

*This work is under publication*

This work was presented in a poster presentation in *the 6th ISEE Symposium and the 20th Korea-Japan/11th Asia Ocean Color Workshop*: [Advanced Machine Learning Approach for Chlorophyll-a Retrieval with SGLI/GCOM-C Data](../files/3LATNet_Poster.pdf).

## [Chla-Algorithms](https://github.com/muhammads97/Chla-algorithms)
This project provide implementation and evaluation utilities for the major remote sensing Chla estimation algorithms, this module includes various algorithms implemented for different satellite sensors. \
We implement different versions of the OCx algorithm, OCI, 2-band ratio, and other standard algorithms.
Our main focus is on the sensors: SGLI, MSI, and OLCI. \
