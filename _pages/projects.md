## [SGLICollect](https://github.com/muhammads97/SGLICollect)
SGLICollect is an open source software for searching, downloading and reading SGLI/GCOM-C products from both GPORTAL and JASMES. \
This project is built using Python as the main programming language, it's developed for the research community, and will soon have a Graphical User Interface for the ease of use. I will also create an installable version of the software so that the dependencies don't cause any problems for the users. it's still under development, feel free to create issues or PR. \
*Acknowledgement: This project is developed as part of my master's degree in Kyoto University of Advanced Science, under the Remote Sensing Laboratory.* \
