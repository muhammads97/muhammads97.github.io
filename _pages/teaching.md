**Private programming classes for high school students:**\
During my bachelor's degree, I gave a few high school students programming 101 courses using C language, I focused on teaching students how to think like the computer and how to convert ideas into code. I also focused on teaching them how to write clean code.

**Unofficial supervision for undergraduate students in the remote sensing lab:**\
I helped a few undergraduate students in learning programming and join our Laboratory, after they joined the Lab, I took over their onboarding, and I taught them the principles of remote sensing, satellite data, atmospheric correction, remote sensing reflectance, etc. I also taught them how to use tools like Python, pandas, NetCDF, Numpy and matplotlib to conduct their research in our Lab. I currently supervise them while they work on different projects, including Harmful Algal Bloom detection and classification, Water Quality parameter estimation, and fine-tuning Chla algorithms.
